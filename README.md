# install and setup

If you want to use dwave solver, regist an account at [D-Wave Leap](https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/) and set your `token`, `endpoint`, `solver` in `graph_computing/regist_info.json` 
(beware to keep the token secret. To prevent an accident, you can make a new file `regist_info_.json` and change the value of `regist_info_path` to `regist_info_.json` in `config.py`. The new file will be ignored by git due to `.gitignore`.)

# start apps

```cd graph_computing```

```python app.py```

# develop

## how to add a new algorithm
1. implement a new class in `graph_computing/models/**.py` 
1. add the function to `model_map` in `graph_computing/utils/model_utils.py`

## how to add a new graph
1. create a `{graph name}.json`(see `utils.make_graph_json.py`) to `graph_view/graphs/`
2. add the `{graph name}` in `graph_view/graphs/list.json`

## TODO
1. display links as results
1. add a maximum value to the exact solver, so a request would not crush the server
